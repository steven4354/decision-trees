# Decision Trees

**decision tree - a creation of "questions"**
**ID3 algo - the most common algo to generate a decision tree**

**random forests**

What if instead of making one decision tree you made several. As many as you wanted, really. A whole forest. Then each tree in the forest got a vote on the outcome for a given observation. Then you'd have a new model type: **Random Forest**. Random forests have become an incredibly popular technique for data scientists because it tends to be a top performer in a huge number of circumstances, with low variance and high accuracy.
